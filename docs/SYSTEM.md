## What Ciara OS is

Ciara OS is a **personal execution system** — not a generic to-do list. It is built around how a techie actually works when juggling:

- Deep technical work (engineering, security, CTF practice)
- Active projects with next actions
- A job/program application pipeline
- Weekly reflection and course correction

The app answers three questions every day:

1. **What should I execute right now?** → Today queue + Deep Work Engine  
2. **What is the strategic picture?** → Projects, Pipeline, Executive Brief (AI)  
3. **Am I improving over time?** → Performance Snapshot, Executive Debrief (Review)

**Privacy model:** All task, project, opportunity, focus-session, and review data lives **on your device** in SQLite. Nothing is uploaded unless you explicitly run the optional local AI backend and tap **Generate Today's Mission** — and even then, only a structured summary of your execution context is sent to Groq via your machine.

---

## Who it is for

Designed for a single operator (you) building a career in **software engineering and cybersecurity** while:

- Applying to jobs, internships, fellowships, and programs  
- Shipping portfolio projects  
- Practicing security skills  
- Needing honest daily prioritization without motivational fluff  

The AI Executive Agent is tuned for that profile: it cites real task names, pipeline deadlines, and postpone patterns — not generic productivity advice.

---

## Core concepts

| Concept | Plain language | Technical flag / store |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Backlog** | Everything you might do | All tasks in SQLite |
| **Today queue** | What you committed to execute today | `tasks.today == true` |
| **Started** | You are actively working this task (focus session) | `tasks.started` + `focus_sessions` |
| **Deep work** | Timed focus on one task toward a 45-min goal | `focus_sessions` rows |
| **Done** | Task is complete | `tasks.status == done` |
| **Project** | Multi-step outcome with a next action | `projects` table |
| **Pipeline lead** | Job/program opportunity with stages & documents | `opportunities` table |
| **Executive Brief** | AI morning mission from live context | Groq via local backend |
| **Executive Debrief** | Weekly score, narrative, reflections | `weekly_reviews` + rule-based generators |

### Today queue vs completion

These are **independent** fields by design, with one automation:

- **`today`** — “show on Today screen”  
- **`status`** — lifecycle (`notStarted` → `inProgress` → `done`)

When you **mark a task complete**, `Task.markedDone()` sets:

- `status: done`  
- `today: false` (removes from Today list)  
- `started: false`  

Completed work still counts in **Performance Snapshot** for the calendar day (see [Performance Snapshot](#performance-snapshot-today)).

## Daily & weekly loops

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph daily [Daily loop — Today screen]
    A[Open Today] --> B[Executive Brief optional]
    B --> C[Today's Focus Plan]
    C --> D[Deep Work on one task]
    D --> E[Mark complete / pause]
    E --> F[Performance Snapshot updates]
  end

  subgraph weekly [Weekly loop — Review screen]
    G[Observe week metrics] --> H[Execution Score + Timeline]
    H --> I[Reflect: well / slowed / improve]
    I --> J[Finalize Debrief]
    J --> K[Next week priorities]
  end

  daily --> weekly
```

**Daily:** Plan → Execute → Measure (same day).  
**Weekly:** Observe → Measure → Understand → Reflect → Improve → Prepare.

## Repositories & project layout

Ciara OS spans two repos on disk:

```
~/Documents/
├── ciara_os/              # Flutter app (this repo)
└── ciara_os_backend/      # FastAPI AI backend (sibling, optional)
    ├── main.py
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── .env.example       # GROQ, GitHub, HTB/H1, Notion, Google OAuth keys
    └── .env               # gitignored — never commit
```

The Flutter app runs fully offline for core execution. The optional backend powers the **Executive Brief**, **GitHub Activity**, **Security Practice** API syncs, **Notion** note import, and **Google Calendar** OAuth.

---

## Navigation & routing

### Onboarding gate

Until `onboarding_complete` is set in SharedPreferences, all routes redirect to `/onboarding`. After completion, `/onboarding` redirects to `/`.

### Primary shell (`ShellRoute`)

Five bottom-nav tabs inside `PrimaryShellScaffold` + `PrimaryNavBar`.

On first shell mount, if an interrupted `focus_sessions` row exists (`endedAt IS NULL`), **Session Recovery** offers Resume or Discard.

| Tab | Route | Screen |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Today | `/` | `TodayScreen` |
| Backlog | `/tasks` | `TasksScreen` |
| Projects | `/projects` | `ProjectsScreen` |
| Pipeline | `/opportunities` | `OpportunitiesScreen` |
| Review | `/review` | `ReviewScreen` |

### Secondary routes (full-screen, no bottom nav)

| Route | Screen |
|-------|--------|
| `/onboarding` | `OnboardingScreen` |
| `/daily-brief` | `DailyBriefScreen` |
| `/calendar` | `CalendarScreen` |
| `/profile` | `ProfileScreen` |
| `/settings` | `SettingsScreen` |
| `/tasks/completed` | `CompletedTasksScreen` |
| `/tasks/new` | `TaskCreateEditScreen` (create) |
| `/tasks/:id` | `TaskDetailScreen` |
| `/tasks/:id/edit` | `TaskCreateEditScreen` (edit) |
| `/projects/new` | `ProjectCreateEditScreen` (create) |
| `/projects/:id` | `ProjectDetailScreen` |
| `/projects/:id/edit` | `ProjectCreateEditScreen` (edit) |
| `/opportunities/new` | `OpportunityCreateEditScreen` (create) |
| `/opportunities/:id` | `OpportunityDetailScreen` |
| `/opportunities/:id/edit` | `OpportunityCreateEditScreen` (edit) |

### Sidebar routes (drawer — `PrimaryDrawer`)

Opened from the hamburger drawer; use `SidebarScreenScaffold` + `TodayHeader`.

| Section | Route | Screen |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Skills · GitHub | `/skills/github` | `GitHubActivityScreen` |
| Skills · GitHub repos | `/skills/github/repos` | `GitHubRepositoriesScreen` |
| Skills · Security | `/skills/ctf` | `SecurityPracticeScreen` |
| Skills · Certifications | `/skills/certifications` | `CertificationsScreen` |
| Analytics · Trends | `/analytics/trends` | `ProductivityTrendsScreen` |
| Analytics · Domains | `/analytics/domains` | `DomainBreakdownScreen` |
| Analytics · Accuracy | `/analytics/accuracy` | `PlanningAccuracyScreen` |
| Knowledge · Notes | `/knowledge/notes` | `NotesScreen` |
| Knowledge · Note editor | `/knowledge/notes/new`, `/knowledge/notes/:id` | `NoteEditorScreen` |
| Knowledge · Resources | `/knowledge/resources` | `ResourcesScreen` |

**Empty states:** Analytics and skills screens use three data states (threshold not met · partial · full). See `.cursor/rules/analytics-skills-empty-states.mdc`.

**Query parameters:**

- `/tasks/new?projectId=…&title=…` — pre-fill project link and title

**Header chrome:** `TodayHeader` on primary and sidebar screens:

| Control | Position | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Profile avatar | Left (replaces hamburger) | Opens navigation drawer |
| Terminal + **Ciara OS** | Left | Brand label |
| Calendar | Right (first) | `/calendar` if Google authorized; otherwise calendar setup sheet |
| Daily Brief | Right (second) | `/daily-brief` morning gate screen |

Drawer is opened from the **left avatar** only (not a separate menu icon). Profile is reachable from the drawer header avatar or `/profile`.

---

## Data model

**Schema version:** 10

Additional tables (v7–v10): `certifications`, `notes`, `resources`, `security_manual_logs`.

### Tasks

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id` | int | Auto-increment PK |
| `title` | text | Required |
| `domain` | text | `Domain` enum name |
| `status` | text | Default `notStarted` |
| `priority` | text | Default `medium` |
| `started` | bool | Synced with active focus session |
| `today` | bool | In today's execution queue |
| `deadline` | DateTime? | Optional due date |
| `projectId` | int? | FK → projects |
| `notes` | text? | Execution notes |
| `postponeCount` | int | Deferral counter |

| `planningAccuracy` | real? | 0–100, set on task completion |
| `lastFocusSessionAt` | DateTime? | Last completed session |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | DateTime | Audit timestamps |

**Completion helper:** `Task.markedDone()` → `done` + `today: false` + `started: false`.

### Focus sessions (`focus_sessions`)

Each row is one deep work session bound to exactly one task. Only one row may have `endedAt IS NULL` at a time.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|

| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | DateTime | |

### Weekly reviews

| Field | Type | Notes |

| `isNotionSynced` | bool | Imported from Notion |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | DateTime | |

### Security manual logs (`security_manual_logs`, v10)

Locally persisted HTB/HackerOne practice you log manually. Survives backend restarts (backend `/api/security/log` is in-memory only).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id` | int | PK |
| `platform` | text | `htb` or `h1` |
| `activityType` | text | `machine`, `challenge`, or `report` |

| v3 | `opportunities.location` |
| v4 | `projects.timeAllocationDays` |
| v5 | `focus_sessions` table; task deep work columns |
| v6 | Weekly review debrief fields |

## Time, tasks & metrics

Ciara OS tracks **execution quality**, not just elapsed time.

| Concept | Unit | Persisted? | Where used |
|---------|------|------------|------------|
| Focus session | Seconds | Yes | Deep Work card, task detail, AI context |
| 45-min Deep Work Goal | Seconds | Reference | Progress ring; timer continues past goal |
| `started` flag | Boolean | Yes | Task rows; Deep Work Engine |
| `today` flag | Boolean | Yes | Today queue (cleared on complete) |
| Estimated duration | Minutes | Yes | Session planning, planning accuracy |
| Planning accuracy | 0–100 | Yes | Task detail, Performance Snapshot |
| Focus quality | Enum | Yes | End-session dialog, daily averages |
| Task deadline | Calendar date | Yes | Badges, filters |
| Project time allocation | Days | Yes | Milestone math |
| Focus uptime (daily) | Seconds | SharedPreferences | Performance Snapshot |
| Daily streak | Days | SharedPreferences | Performance Snapshot |
| Weekly started-rate | % | Computed | Review aggregate |

### Deep Work Engine

**Provider:** `focusSessionProvider` (`DeepWorkEngineNotifier`)

**Rules:**

- One globally active session (`endedAt IS NULL`)
- Start → `focus_sessions` row + `task.started = true`
- Pause → checkpoint elapsed, flush daily stats, `task.started = false`
- End → quality rating required; updates task aggregates; clears active state
- Progress toward 45 min is visual only — clock keeps running
- Checkpoint every 15s to SQLite for crash recovery
- App launch → recovery dialog if orphaned session exists

**Planning accuracy** (`computePlanningAccuracy`): on complete, compares estimate vs actual focused time → 0–100 score. Persisted via `TaskCompletionService.markTaskDone()` from task detail, backlog quick actions, and backlog list — not only from the detail screen. Qualifying tasks need an estimate, `totalFocusedSeconds > 0`, and a computed score.

### Performance Snapshot (Today)

**Provider:** `todayPerformanceProvider`  
**UI:** `PerformanceSnapshotCard` in `TodaySidebar`

| Tile | Logic |
|------|-------|
| **Completed** | `completedToday / totalToday` — see below |
| **Deep work** | Persisted daily seconds + unflushed active session |
| **Sessions** | Completed sessions today (+ active if any) |
| **Focus quality** | Mean quality score of today's sessions |
| **Accuracy** | Mean `planningAccuracy` of day's task set |
| **Streak** | Consecutive active days |

**Day task set** (`tasksForPerformanceDay` in `task_filter_utils.dart`):

- **Total:** tasks with `today == true` **OR** completed today (`status == done` and `updatedAt` on today's calendar date)  
- **Completed count:** all tasks completed today (even if removed from today queue)

This keeps `2/3` correct after marking tasks done (they leave the list but still count for the day).

---

## AI layer (Executive Brief)

### Overview

The **Executive Brief** is a morning AI card on the Today screen. It sends a structured snapshot of your execution context to a local FastAPI backend, which calls **Groq** (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) and returns a focused mission — not motivational fluff.

**User flow:**

1. Open Today → see **Executive Brief** above **TODAY'S FOCUS PLAN**  
2. Tap **⚡ Generate Today's Mission** (or refresh when loaded)  
3. Card shows greeting, mission, risk, recommendation, priority score, expected outcome  
4. Collapse after reading — stays collapsed on return visits (session cache)  
5. On failure → specific error (connection vs invalid API key vs AI parse error)

### Flutter components

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `widgets/today/executive_brief_card.dart` | UI: empty / loading / loaded / error / collapsed |
| `services/ai_context_builder.dart` | Builds JSON payload from local providers |
| `services/ai_service.dart` | HTTP client, `AiFetchResult` error mapping |
| `models/executive_brief.dart` | Typed response (`ExecutiveBrief`, mission, risk) |
| `providers/ai_providers.dart` | `aiServiceProvider`, `executiveBriefProvider` |

**Context payload** (`AiContextBuilder.build`):

| Key | Source |
|-----|--------|
| `date` | Today (ISO `yyyy-MM-dd`) |
| `tasks_today` | `todayTasksProvider` |
| `this_week` | `weekTasksProvider(monday)` — started rate, completed/total, focused hours |
| `active_projects` | `allProjectsProvider` (status `active`) + pending linked tasks |
| `opportunities_due_this_week` | Deadlines within 7 days |
| `patterns` | Most postponed task across `allTasksProvider` |

**Backend URL:** `AiServiceConfig.baseUrl` — default `http://localhost:8001`. Override:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=CIARA_AI_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

**Session cache:** `executiveBriefProvider` holds the brief for the app session; re-fetch on explicit refresh or new generate.

### Python backend (`ciara_os_backend/`)

```

| GET | `/health` | `{"status": "ok"}` |
| POST | `/api/brief` | Executive Brief from JSON context |
| GET | `/api/github/activity` | GitHub profile, week commits, streak, languages (25s client timeout) |
| GET | `/api/github/repos/{name}` | Single repo detail |
| GET | `/api/security/hackthebox` | HTB profile and activity (requires `HTB_API_KEY`) |
| GET | `/api/security/hackerone` | HackerOne profile (requires `H1_USERNAME`, `H1_API_TOKEN`) |
| POST/GET | `/api/security/log` | Manual security practice log (in-memory on backend; app persists locally in SQLite) |
| GET | `/health/notion` | Notion integration health |
| GET | `/api/notion/pages` | List Notion pages available to sync |
| POST | `/api/notion/pages/{page_id}/sync` | Pull a Notion page into local notes |
| GET | `/auth/google` | Google OAuth authorization URL |
| GET | `/auth/google/callback` | OAuth callback (stores tokens in `.tokens.json`) |
| GET | `/auth/google/status` | `{ authorized, email }` — email resolved via userinfo or primary calendar fallback |
| DELETE | `/auth/google/disconnect` | Revoke local Google tokens |
| GET | `/api/calendar/events` | Google Calendar events for date range |
| POST | `/api/calendar/focus-block` | Create a focus block event |
| DELETE | `/api/calendar/events/{event_id}` | Delete a calendar event |

**Environment:** `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `HTB_API_KEY`, `H1_USERNAME`, `H1_API_TOKEN`, `NOTION_TOKEN`, `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`, `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` in `.env`. Restart uvicorn after changing `.env` (reload does not refresh env).

**Run:**

```bash
cd ciara_os_backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

**Response shape (Groq JSON):**

```json
{
  "greeting": "string",
  "mission": { "title", "reason", "estimated_minutes" },
  "risk": { "present": bool, "description": "string|null" },
  "recommendation": "string",
  "priority_score": 0-100,
  "expected_outcome": "string"
}
```

**Errors:** 502 if Groq fails or JSON invalid; Flutter maps these to user-visible messages (invalid API key, backend down, parse failure).

### AI vs rule-based Review

| Feature | Engine | When |
|---------|--------|------|
| Executive Brief | Groq LLM | Daily, on demand |
| Execution Score | `ExecutionScoreCalculator` | Weekly Review |
| Timeline quality | `ExecutionTimelineGenerator` | Weekly Review |
| Insights | `InsightGenerator` | Weekly Review |
| Weekly narrative | `WeeklyNarrativeGenerator` | Weekly Review |

Review generators remain deterministic and swappable; the Brief is the first live LLM integration.

---

## Shared UI & theming

### `TodayHeader`

- Height 56px; **profile avatar** (left) opens drawer; terminal icon + **Ciara OS** (JetBrains Mono)  
- **Calendar** (right) → `/calendar` or setup sheet if Google not authorized  
- **Daily Brief** (right) → `/daily-brief`  
- No hamburger icon — drawer is opened from the left avatar  

### `EmptyState`

Variants: `compact`, `tasks`, `pipeline`, `projects` — used when lists are empty or errored.

### Design tokens

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Typography | Inter (body/headings) + JetBrains Mono (labels) |
| Theme | Dark default; light via Settings |
| Domains | `context.domainColor(Domain)` via `CiaraDomainColors` |
| Max width | 1200px (`AppSpacing.containerMax`) |
| Task left bar | 4px (`AppSpacing.taskBorderWidth`) — domain color on tasks, primary on AI brief |

**Web note:** `AppTypography.textTheme` applies `TextDecoration.none` globally to prevent browser link underlines inside tappable widgets. Tappable `Text` in detail screens also sets explicit `decoration: none`.

---

## Primary screens

### 1. Today — `/`

**Purpose:** Daily execution — the screen you open every morning.

**Layout:**

```
TodayHeader
└─ ScrollView (max-width 1200)
   ├─ TodayScreenLabel       "EXECUTION VIEW" / Today / date
   ├─ TodayActionRow         Filter + New Task
   ├─ CalendarStrip          Week strip + today's events (Google Calendar)
   ├─ ExecutiveBriefCard     AI morning brief (optional)
   ├─ "TODAY'S FOCUS PLAN"   section label
   └─ [wide ≥1024px] 8/4 | [narrow] stacked
      ├─ TodayTaskListSection
      └─ TodaySidebar
```

**ExecutiveBriefCard states:**

| State | UI |
|-------|-----|
| Not loaded | Label + **Generate Today's Mission** |
| Loading | Spinner + "Analyzing your execution context…" |
| Loaded | Full brief; refresh + collapse |

**TodayTaskListSection**

- Data: `filteredTodayTasksProvider` (`today == true` + filters)  
- Grouped by domain  
- Started toggle → `focusSessionProvider`  
- Tap → task detail  

**TodaySidebar**

1. `DeepWorkCard` — active session UI  
2. `PerformanceSnapshotCard` — 2×3 metrics grid  
3. `BuilderModeCard` — builder-domain today tasks  

---

### 2. Backlog — `/tasks`

Full task inventory, filters, quick-add bar. Checkbox marks done via `Task.markedDone()` (clears today flag).

---

### 3. Projects — `/projects`

Project registry → detail with linked tasks, next action, external link, time allocation.

---

### 4. Pipeline — `/opportunities`

Application pipeline by stage. `OpportunityCard` uses `IntrinsicHeight` for list layout. Documents checklist uses `Material` wrapper for web ink splash.

**Stages:** Researching → Applying → Submitted → Interviewing → Offer → Rejected → Closed

---

### 5. Review — `/review`

**Executive Debrief** — weekly loop closure.

**Header structure** (`ReviewScreenHeader`):

```
EXECUTIVE DEBRIEF
Week 27 • June 29 – July 5, 2026
Strategic performance analysis and system recalibration.
```

Week number and date range derive from `mondayOfWeek(DateTime.now())` via `reviewWeekHeaderLabel()` in `review_stats_utils.dart`. The header sits close to `TodayHeader` with compact top padding.

- Execution Score (weighted formula)  
- Timeline (Mon–Sun quality bars)  
- Weekly narrative + insights  
- Reflection cards × 3  
- Next week priorities  
- Finalize → locked `WeeklyReview`  

**Provider:** `weeklyDebriefProvider` → `WeeklyReviewService.buildDebrief()`

---

## Secondary screens

### Onboarding — `/onboarding`

4-step `PageView`: welcome → domains → started habit demo → system ready.  
`OnboardingNotifier.markComplete()` → SharedPreferences.

### Profile — `/profile`

Identity card (tagline editable), domain breakdown, week stats, GitHub link, theme-aware styling.

### Settings — `/settings`

### Task detail — `/tasks/:id`

Modal-style card: status, Deep Work section, deadline, parent project, notes, metadata, Today toggle, Pause + **Mark Complete** (`markedDone()`).

### Task create / edit

Title, domain, priority, status (edit), estimate, deadline, project, today flag, notes. Saving with status `done` forces `today: false`.

### Project & Opportunity detail / forms

Pipeline stepper, documents checklist, fit notes, linked tasks. **Lead quality** (1–3 stars) on both create/edit forms and detail metadata. Application link validation (URL or email).

### Daily Brief — `/daily-brief`

## Running & development

### Flutter app

```bash
cd ciara_os
flutter pub get
flutter run
# Linux desktop or Chrome web
```

After schema migration bump: **full restart** (not hot reload). Regenerate Drift after table changes:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

**App icon** (after changing `assets/icon/`):

```bash
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

**With AI backend:**

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
cd ciara_os_backend && source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001

# Terminal 2 — app
cd ciara_os
flutter run --dart-define=CIARA_AI_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

### Backend only

```bash
cd ciara_os_backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # add GROQ_API_KEY
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

### Platforms tested

Linux desktop, Chrome web.

### Git branches (feature work)

Executive Brief + AI client: `feature/ai-executive-brief`
